# PixelBox - Particle Aquarium

A pixel-based physics simulation game built with Phaser 3, where each pixel acts as a particle with unique physical properties. Features a **modular, property-based interaction system** that makes it incredibly easy to add new elements and interactions. Perfect for mobile and desktop browsers.

  - **Powders**: Sand, gunpowder, ash, salt
  - **Liquids**: Water, oil, acid, lava
  - **Gases**: Fire, steam, smoke, clouds
  - **Solids**: Stone, wood, glass, ice, walls
  - **Living**: Fish, plants, trees
  - **Special**: Fossils (generate oil over time), burning wood
- **Touch & Mouse Controls**: Draw particles with your finger or mouse
- **Performance Optimized**: Handles thousands of particles smoothly on mobile

# Update version.js to reflect your changes (see versioning guide below)
# Then commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push
```
Changes go live automatically at https://ninjaboy.github.io/pixelbox/

**Versioning Guide:**
- **Major versions (X.0.0)**: Significant new features or gameplay changes
- **Minor versions (x.X.0)**: New elements, mechanics, or substantial improvements
- **Patch versions (x.x.X)**: Bug fixes and minor tweaks

**Alternative: Vercel** (Manual)
```bash
vercel --prod
```
Note: Free tier has 100 deployments/day limit

## How to Play

1. **Select an Element**: Click/tap one of the element buttons at the bottom of the screen
2. **Draw**: Click and drag (or touch and drag on mobile) to spawn particles
3. **Experiment**: Try combining different elements:
   - Pour water on fire to create steam
   - Build containers with stone
   - Create wood structures and set them on fire
   - Watch sand pour through barriers

## Element Interactions

- **Water + Fire** → Steam (fire extinguished)
- **Water + Lava** → Stone (lava solidifies after evaporating 5+ water pixels)
- **Fire + Wood/Oil/Gunpowder** → Ignition and burning
- **Lava** → Ignites combustibles, emits smoke, slowly cools to stone (5 minutes)
- **Ice + Heat** → Melts to water
- **Ice + Water** → Freezes adjacent water
- **Wood** → Buried in sand/stone for 20s becomes fossil
- **Fossil** → Slowly generates oil
- **Gunpowder + Fire** → Explosive burning
- **Fish** → Swims in water, AI-driven behavior
- **Trees** → Grow from wood placed near sand/water

## Technical Details

- **Engine**: Phaser 3.86.0
- **Rendering**: WebGL with fallback to Canvas2D
- **Grid System**: 2D array-based cellular automata
- **Pixel Size**: 4x4 pixels for optimal performance
- **Physics**: Custom implementation using density-based interactions
- **Update Order**: Bottom-to-top with randomized left-right to prevent bias

## Performance

- **Target**: 60 FPS (maintained even with 10,000+ particles)
- **Optimizations**:
  - Active cell tracking (only updates non-empty cells)
  - Numeric coordinate keys (eliminates string parsing overhead)
  - Reduced interaction checks (every 2 frames)
  - Cached AI computations for fish
  - Water depth measurement limits
- **Mobile Optimized**: Tested on iOS Safari and Chrome for Android
- **ES6 Modules**: Modern JavaScript architecture

## Architecture

PixelBox uses a **property-based interaction system**. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed documentation.

### Quick Example: How Interactions Work

Instead of hardcoding "water + fire = steam":
- **Water** has tag `EVAPORATES` and property `evaporatesInto: 'steam'`
- **Fire** has tag `HEAT_SOURCE`
- **Interaction Rule**: `EVAPORATES + HEAT_SOURCE → evaporate`

This means ANY element with `EVAPORATES` will transform when touching ANY `HEAT_SOURCE`!

## Customization

### Adding New Elements

Create a new element file in `src/elements/`:

```javascript
// src/elements/OilElement.js
import Element from '../Element.js';
import { STATE, TAG } from '../ElementProperties.js';

class OilElement extends Element {
    constructor() {
        super(7, 'oil', 0x3d3d1a, {
            density: 1.5,
            state: STATE.LIQUID,
            tags: [TAG.COMBUSTIBLE],  // Will ignite near fire!
            burnsInto: 'fire'
        });
    }

    update(x, y, grid) {
        // Liquid movement logic
        if (grid.canMoveTo(x, y, x, y + 1)) {
            grid.swap(x, y, x, y + 1);
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

export default OilElement;
```

Then register it in `src/init.js`:
```javascript
import { OilElement } from './elements/index.js';
registry.register(new OilElement());
```

That's it! The interaction system handles the rest automatically.

### Adjusting Performance

In `src/main.js`, around line 25:

```javascript
this.pixelSize = 4; // Increase for better performance, decrease for more detail
```

In `src/main.js`, around line 15:

```javascript
this.brushSize = 5; // Adjust drawing brush size
```
